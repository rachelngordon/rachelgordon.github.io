### Personal

I seem to always be changing but people often describe me as energetic, funny, and open. I love traveling, cooking, sports, gardening, and spending time with my partner Laura.  I try to value relationships & experiences more than stuff. I want to be remembered as someone with a big heart.

Insight Meditation practice has and continues to change my life for the better.

#### My Story

**I was born in Tokyo, Japan.**  My mom was born here while my grandpa was at CalTech [^1], which enables me to be a US citizen[^2]. Balancing my Japanese roots with my American upbringing was challenging but rewarding.

**Grew up in Hawaii** which is a gentle, beautiful place. Blessed to have grown up there.

**Moved to Northern California in 2008.** I went to a hippy-arts type of High School in Sacramento. I played sports & loved doing theatre. I also love Sac!

**UC Berkeley / East Bay.** At Berkeley, I was mostly interested in clean energy (statistics was a secondary interest).  After college, I worked for a major solar energy developer.

**Big Changes.** In 2019, let go from what I thought was my dream job. I went on an amazing trip to SE Asia. I also began dating Laura & started to seriously meditate: these three things I think have been the best things that have ever happened to me.

**Back in Sacramento.** Moved back right before Covid. Worked at the State Government which made me believe in the importance of people with technical skills in civil service.

**Now:**  Currently a PhD student splitting my time between Sacramento & Santa Cruz. I play meditate and play softball on my spare time.
