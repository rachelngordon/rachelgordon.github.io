### Personal
<!--
I seem to always be changing but people often describe me as energetic, funny, and open. I love traveling, cooking, sports, gardening, and spending time with my partner Laura.  I try to value relationships & experiences more than stuff. I want to be remembered as someone with a big heart.

Insight Meditation practice has and continues to change my life for the better.

#### My Story
<!--
**I was born and raised in Pickerington, Ohio.**  Being just 30 minutes from Columbus, I grew up in a huge Ohio State football family

My mom was born here while my grandpa was at CalTech [^1], which enables me to be a US citizen[^2]. Balancing my Japanese roots with my American upbringing was challenging but rewarding.

**Grew up in Hawaii** which is a gentle, beautiful place. Blessed to have grown up there.

**Moved to Northern California in 2008.** I went to a hippy-arts type of High School in Sacramento. I played sports & loved doing theatre. I also love Sac!

**UC Berkeley / East Bay.** At Berkeley, I was mostly interested in clean energy (statistics was a secondary interest).  After college, I worked for a major solar energy developer.

**Big Changes.** In 2019, let go from what I thought was my dream job. I went on an amazing trip to SE Asia. I also began dating Laura & started to seriously meditate: these three things I think have been the best things that have ever happened to me.

**Back in Sacramento.** Moved back right before Covid. Worked at the State Government which made me believe in the importance of people with technical skills in civil service.

**Now:**  Currently a PhD student splitting my time between Sacramento & Santa Cruz. I play meditate and play softball on my spare time.

#### Hobbies

I strongly believe in the importance of having hobbies and other interests outside of work, as they allow us to utilize different parts of our brain and further enrich our lives. Some of my favorites include embroidery or other crafty and creative mediums, as these allow me to work with my hands and let my mind wander. Check out my recent embroidery projects on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/embroiderywithrach/).

I also love reading books, specifically contemporary, literary, or historical fiction, as well as memoirs, essays, philosophy, and psychology. Check out what I’ve been reading lately on [StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/rachelngordon). 

It is also important for me to have hobbies that get me out of the house and out of my head. Recently, I have really enjoyed taking [boxing classes](https://www.titleboxing.com/) and attending stand-up comedy shows in Chicago.
