### Personal

I am passionate about learning new things, questioning my perceptions of the world, and building meaningful connections. 
<!-- My core values include curiosity, creativity, and connection (love the alliteration), and I strive to incorporate these things into all that I do. -->

Things that excite me on a daily basis include trying new foods, playing with my cats, traveling, making things, playing board games, and spending time laughing with friends and family.


#### My Story

**I was born and raised in Pickerington, Ohio.**  

<!--Being just 30 minutes from Columbus, I grew up in a huge Ohio State football family who regularly hosted football parties (although I definitely cared more about the food than the game ðŸ˜ƒ).-->

I grew up doing things like Taekwondo and volleyball, and have always found joy in starting my own creative projects. In high school, I started a math tutoring business and made [animated educational videos](https://www.youtube.com/@rachelgordon2514/videos).

<!--Although I loved where I grew up, I always knew I wanted to move to a city eventually...-->

**I moved to Chicago for school in 2019** and fell in love with the city. I'm so grateful to call this place home.

I majored in Statistics at Loyola University Chicago and met some of my best friends, including my partner Stephen.

**I started my Master's program in 2022** and started working on my thesis. 

This project furthered my love for data science by allowing me to learn about fields outside my own and by showing me the impact this work can have on healthcare as a whole.

<!--During the program, I also had the opportunity to travel to a conference in Ha Noi, Viet Nam, which is an experience I am incredibly grateful for and will cherish forever.-->

**Upcoming Life Transitions.** 

Although a year ago I was set on going into industry after completing my degree, I have gained clarity on my goals and next steps through conversations with mentors and experts in my desired field. 

In the coming months, I'll be moving out of Rogers Park and preparing to pursue my PhD in Computer Science at [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en). 


#### Hobbies

I strongly believe in the importance of having hobbies and other interests outside of work, as they allow us to utilize different parts of our brain and further enrich our lives. Some of my favorite hobbies include [embroidery](https://www.instagram.com/embroiderywithrach/) or other crafty and creative mediums, as these allow me to work with my hands and let my mind wander. <!--Check out my recent embroidery projects on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/embroiderywithrach/). --> 

I also love [reading books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/rachelngordon), specifically contemporary, literary, or historical fiction, as well as memoirs, essays, philosophy, and psychology. <!--Check out what Iâ€™ve been reading lately on [StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/rachelngordon). -->

<!--It is also important for me to have hobbies that get me out of the house and out of my head.-->
Recently, I have enjoyed taking [boxing classes](https://www.titleboxing.com/) and attending stand-up comedy shows.
