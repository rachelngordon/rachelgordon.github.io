### Research Interests

> If I were advising a young person today... I would say "Take statistics, but remember that the great adventure of statistics is in gathering and using data to solve interesting an important real world problems".  - **Leo Breiman**

I am broadly interested in developing statistical tools for applications relevant to public policy and public health.
More specifically I'm interested in:

* Official Statistics
* Small Area Estimation
* Disease Mapping
* Areal Data Modeling
* Markov Random Field Models
* Bayesian Methods

I am co-advised by [Zehang Li](https://zehangli.com) and [Paul Parker](https://www.paparkerstat.com).

### Teaching

Teaching is arguably the most impactful part of my graduate training. I have especially enjoyed teaching introductory statistics.

#### Stat 5 Curriculum Re-Development

I'm currently working with [Professor Marcela Alfaro Córdoba](https://malfaro.netlify.app/) on redeveloping the curriculum for one of the intro-statistics class at UC Santa Cruz (Stat 5).  I'm excited about this work, especially since Stat 5 is a class over 1200 students take every year!

#### Classes TA-ed At UCSC

The following are the classes I have TA-ed for.
If you're a TA and would like access to any of my slides or materials, please contact me.
